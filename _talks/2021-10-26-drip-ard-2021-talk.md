excerpt: 'Current AutoML research aims to minimize the Discovery time of high-performing models, e.g. &quot;find best model within 30 mins&quot;. However, ideally most models are trained, and used in production for months before refresh, meaning the costs operational cost of running an AutoML model in production far exceeds the one-time discovery cost. Instead, can AutoML systems discover high-performing models which operate within an explicit budget? We propose a new AutoML paradigm, DRiP (Discover-Refine-Productionize) which not only allows cost-backwards optimization, but produces a cost-performance tradeoff curve for users to choose an appropriate point. We compare to AutoGluon v0.2 and find that DRiP AutoML can be tuned to achieve: (i) On-par performance at low cost (ii) Minimum overall cost (iii) Maximum overall performance.'

**Abstract:**
Current AutoML research aims to minimize the Discovery time of high-performing models, e.g. &quot;find best model within 30 mins&quot;. However, ideally most models are trained, and used in production for months before refresh, meaning the costs operational cost of running an AutoML model in production far exceeds the one-time discovery cost. Instead, can AutoML systems discover high-performing models which operate within an explicit budget? We propose a new AutoML paradigm, DRiP (Discover-Refine-Productionize) which not only allows cost-backwards optimization, but produces a cost-performance tradeoff curve for users to choose an appropriate point. We compare to AutoGluon v0.2 and find that DRiP AutoML can be tuned to achieve: (i) On-par performance at low cost (ii) Minimum overall cost (iii) Maximum overall performance.

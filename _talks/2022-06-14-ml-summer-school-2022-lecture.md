I was an instructor at Amazon ML Summer School 2022, which enrolled ~3,000 Indian undergraduate students and helped them learn key ML technologies from Amazon Scientists, making them industry ready for science careers. My role involved teaching a 1-hour long module on Supervised Learning and a 3-hour Q&amp;A session to clarify student questions.
